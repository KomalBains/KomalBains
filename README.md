Hi there 👋

My name is Komal Bains! 

I’m a Data Scientist and Analytics Engineer with a passion for turning data into insights that drive real business impact. I help companies solve complex problems using data, machine learning, and analytics.

Currently, I work at Verizon, where I build systems that detect fraud and risk on large scale transactional data. My work has helped prevent over $20M in losses and created dashboards that make data easy to understand for business leaders.

I’m also a graduate student in Artificial Intelligence at the University of North Texas, with a strong foundation in machine learning, data science, and software engineering.

What I Do: 
Build data pipelines and analytics systems that make business decisions smarter
Develop machine learning models that detect fraud and predict outcomes
Create dashboards and reports to make complex data simple for leaders
Collaborate across teams to turn data into measurable results

Skills: 
Data & Analytics: Python, SQL, ETL pipelines, dashboards
Machine Learning: Classification, anomaly detection, predictive modeling
Cloud & Tools: AWS, GCP, Tableau, Looker
Communication: Explain technical results in plain language to decision-makers

Achievements:
